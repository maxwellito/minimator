  <h1>What is minimator?</h1>

  <p>Minimator is a minimalist graphical editor.</p>
  <p>All drawings are made of lines in a grid based canvas. The lines are limited to vertical and horizontal lines, and quarter circles.</p>
  <p>The editor was built with touch tablets in mind. Providing undo/redo/zoom/move in a simple gesture. An info tooltip is available in the editor to list the shortcuts available.</p>
  <p>If you want to use it offline, add the page to your homescreen.<br/>On iPad, press the ${icon('share', 'shareEvent', 'Share artwork')} icon in the top right corner then tap on "Add to homescreen".</p>
  <p>The editor provides tools to save your work and share it easily, but also a feature to 'replay' the drawing. Please use the keyword 'minimator' while sharing your work on social media. I'm looking forward to seeing what you will draw.</p>
  <p>All data is stored locally on your device. No tracking and no data collection. There's nothing more GDPR compliant than this.</p>
